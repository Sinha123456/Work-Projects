### Indicator 4 calculations: Included Indicator 4A and 4B calculations.
## Indicator 4A is a compliance indicator that flags school corporations with significantly more than 10 days of out-of-school suspensions or expulsions for students with disabilities (SWD) compared to the rate for students without disabilities.
## Indicator 4B is result-driven accountability, which flags districts with similar discrepancies in suspension/expulsion rates, but specifically for racial or ethnic subgroups of SWD. A district is flagged only if this discrepancy is also linked to non-compliant policies or practices.
## Indicator 9 is a compliance indicator that flags school districts with a disproportionate representation of any racial or ethnic group in overall special education identification, based on a comparison risk ratio over three years. 
## Indicator 10 flags districts with a disproportionate representation of any racial or ethnic group in six specific disability categories, also calculated using a risk ratio over three years. 
### For both indicators, a district is only officially flagged if it is determined that the disproportionate representation is the result of inappropriate identification procedures. 
## Significant Disproportionality calculation: Calculating significant disproportionality across identification, placement, and discipline. A risk ratio compares a racial or ethnic group's percentage in a specific special education category to that of all other students. 
### If this ratio exceeds a state-defined threshold for three consecutive years, with adequate student numbers, significant disproportionality is found. A determination is then made on whether inappropriate identification, placement, or disciplinary policies caused the discrepancy
